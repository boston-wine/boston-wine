I have real name too, but I go by Boston Wine around here.

My career path has been a blend of wine and tech positions, primarily in Boston and the Northeastern US.

I am currently learning everything I can about bitcoin, making a digital home for myself on nostr, and beginning to contribute in small ways to open source projects on GitHub.
